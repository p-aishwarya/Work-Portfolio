      <h1 class="w3-center">About Web Scraping</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large">Initial thoughts on web scraping as a work would be trivial, easy, and unimportant. However, I have realised through the 4 weeks of internship at Multiverse that it is one of the most important steps in the Data science pipeline which most of us turn a blind eye to. </p>
      <p class="w3-large">Structured data is of paramount importance when it comes to data analytics but more than 70% of  data present online is unstructured and hence is of little use. However, Web scraping allows us to “legally” collect information from thousands of websites and structure the data into desirable format which eases further steps of the Data science pipeline.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">About Selenium Tool</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large">There are numerous tools  to perform web scraping but the reason I choose selenium over them is that it is an automation testing framework for web applications/websites which can also control the browser to navigate the website just like a human. <br><br>Selenium WebDriver API enables interaction between browsers and browser drivers. This architecture consists of four layers namely the Selenium Client Library, JSON Wire Protocol, Browser Drivers and Browsers. Selenium Client Library consists of languages like Java, Ruby, Python, C# and so on.Working of the selenium tool can be summarized as follows.<br></p><br>

      <p class="w3-large">Sprint 1 gave me an exposure to selenium  and its architecture. I’ve scraped all the 1000 courses from Coursera in the Data Science domain. I had structured the obtained data into the required pre-defined schema as a JSON format and also converted it into a CSV file as well.</p>

            <p class="w3-large">Initially, analysing the data in the website created a turmoil, later after a great endeavour we were able to connect the threads of the data. Finally, we obtained 45K skills(technical,non-technical)  from the website.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">There exists a number of ways to store data in cloud but I have used Amazon S3 to store files because it provides object (file) storage through a web interface. It's built to store, protect and retrieve data from “buckets” at any time from anywhere on any device. A user creates a bucket, and the bucket stores objects in the cloud. </p>

    <p class="w3-large">In Sprint 3, I took a dive into AWS services and explored API Gateway, Lambda, S3. Furthermore, I uploaded the files in S3 bucket, developed a code for creating API calls for both skills and job titles using POST method and provided authorization to internal teams for these API calls for extracting the required data using API Gateway.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">Analysed and modified the code as per requirement  for all the error codes generated while accessing the API calls through POSTMAN tool.

        <h1 class="w3-center">About BERT & FuzzyWuzzy Model</h1><br>
        <p class="w3-large">The reason for choosing BERT algorithm is that it was developed by Google and it is the most lucrative NLP model available for context matching. Applying BERT, Google is able to understand the relationship between words in a query and present the closest matching result to the searcher. <br><br>In the example below, the context of the word “bank” is different in both sentences.Google needs to process the context of the words before the word “bank” in the first query and after the word “bank” in the second query. This is what bidirectional query processing is. Google can process a query both ways depending on the context.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">FuzzyWuzzy algorithm is mainly used for string matching and hence we used it for matching the job titles. FuzzyWuzzy also has more powerful functions to help with matching strings in more complex situations. The partial ratio() function allows us to perform 
          substring matching.</p>

          <p class="w3-large">For Sprint 4, I had researched multiple String matching algorithms and NLP models for matching the Job titles and skills. Later in my analysis, I found BERT and FuzzyWuzzy algorithms as the best fit for my requirement.</p>
          <p class="w3-large">I’ve applied both BERT and FuzzyWuzzy algorithms on a sample data set of around 2000 job titles and skills. </p>
          <p class="w3-large">I compared the results manually and calculated accuracy using a confusion matrix and these results led us to come to a conclusion of cleaning and normalizing the data to improve accuracy of the algorithm as per the requirement . </p>

  <p class="w3-large">For Sprint 5, I had explored and Worked on NESTA data to get some insights and retrieve the job titles to perform analysis. Finally defined an unified schema for NESTA.</p>
  <p class="w3-large">I had worked on improving the accuracy of the algorithm. For this purpose, I’ve applied BERT algorithm on a sample data set of around 1000 Job titles</p>
  <p class="w3-large">Before and after cleaning the data and evaluated the results manually, calculated accuracy, precision,frequency using confusion matrix. <br><br>These results led us to come to a conclusion of  change in True positives and False positives data for the manually cleaned and uncleaned data. Cleaning the data manually  and finding the pattern to remove frivolous data  is a tedious task.</p>
